# Capstone

Our aim is to build a comprehensive skills matching library or model that will improve the
current recruitment process, as we recognise that talent architecture is a huge opportunity area.
The library would ideally match skills from various job portals to those in national competency
frameworks; and facilitate the supply and demand side of matching the right talent with the
strategic needs of its business. Hence, this highly specific and tailored library suited to
Singapore’s context and job market would be one unique point as our library would be able to
enable a bi-directional matching based on the Skills framework and job portal data. Such a
library would present a myriad of advantages including significant time reduction in identifying
the best match for the skills required for current available projects in the company and
optimising talents that already exist in the company based on current employees’ skills.

The notebooks provided in this repo are mostly helper functions for achieving this pipeline:

We have incoporated several kinds of supervised/unsupervised learning models along with NLP techniques to 
build the model above.
